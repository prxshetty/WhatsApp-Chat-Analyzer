I'm looking for a affordable SIM card that I can use for international calls and data. I've heard good things about Lycamobile, but I want to make sure that it's a good choice before I sign up.

If you have any thoughts, please let me know
8/1/23, 12:54 - +1 (585) 498-0463: Terrible network.
8/1/23, 12:56 - +91 83061 85883: Crushed dreams
8/1/23, 12:58 - +1 (585) 498-0463: Sometimes you'll find it difficult to get network indoors as well. 

It is worth getting if you do not plan on traveling outside of any major cities.
8/1/23, 12:59 - +1 (848) 482-0769: De toh sahi

8/1/23, 13:01 - +91 90016 67285: Can I send money through wire transfer if I  choose installments option?
8/1/23, 13:01 - +91 73870 43914: I tried Googling it, but it ends up autocorrecting it to dentistry...
8/1/23, 13:02 - +91 73870 43914: Also, is the renter's insurance yearly or monthly?
8/1/23, 13:02 - +91 73510 10402: Monthly
8/1/23, 13:02 - +1 (585) 498-0463: Either. Depends on the plan you choose.
8/1/23, 13:03 - +91 96680 07457: The 50 dollar/month one
8/1/23, 13:03 - +91 73510 10402: This one in the picture above is apex’s renter’s insurance. This they deduct monthly
8/1/23, 13:03 - +91 73870 43914: This message was deleted
8/1/23, 13:03 - +91 96680 07457: It's 300 Mbps so it's pretty good, I think
8/1/23, 13:04 - +91 73870 43914: This one...?
8/1/23, 13:04 - +91 73510 10402: I tried googling too. It shows its something related to foxen’s renters insurance only. Like some insurance that we will pay the rent on time or something
8/1/23, 13:04 - +91 73510 10402: I am not too sure though
8/1/23, 13:05 - +91 91682 37370: You can opt out from rentistry, its kind of credit building system
8/1/23, 13:05 - +91 73510 10402: Ohh
8/1/23, 13:05 - +91 73870 43914: How does one do that?
8/1/23, 13:06 - +91 91682 37370: Get in touch with the housing authority
8/1/23, 13:06 - +91 73870 43914: Ok, thanks!

And they might ask your stay ka address.
8/3/23, 02:14 - +1 (913) 548-1178: Carry your signed I20 for the immigration. It is a must. Do not forget it.

8/3/23, 02:28 - +91 96192 64870: tello ka plans se better i find mint ka plans

8/3/23, 02:37 - +91 96031 78706: how is the connectivity?
8/3/23, 02:43 - +91 96732 00508: On their website it shows they have active service on Rochester
8/3/23, 02:43 - +91 96732 00508: But you can explore more

8/3/23, 03:18 - +91 83061 85883: I was looking into that and someone mentioned that you need an existing sim card to get into a family plan? 🤨🤨 Is that so?
8/3/23, 03:46 - +1 (913) 548-1178: Existing SIM card as in ? 
You can take up a family plan and add new lines to it. The service provider will give you the SIM card. Or you can get an esim if it’s compatible with your device
8/3/23, 03:46 - +91 84118 88414: has anyone here registered or appeared for RIT’s English Proficiency test?

8/3/23, 04:41 - +91 6205 362 048: That's there too
8/3/23, 04:42 - +91 6205 362 048: Aetna is for health insurance only, right?
8/3/23, 04:44 - +91 76248 08094: Yes
8/3/23, 04:51 - +91 90826 06838: Are we going to pay 903$  every semester? (Meaning 903 x 4?)
8/3/23, 04:52 - +91 6205 362 048: I think so, coz' the estimated cost per year provided by college for the health insurance sums up to that only
8/3/23, 04:54 - +91 99164 14931: No! I think the price is different for the next semester
8/3/23, 04:55 - +91 99164 14931: <Media omitted>

8/4/23, 03:29 - +91 99164 14931: They just need sealed transcripts and the degree certificate
8/4/23, 03:30 - +91 99960 60246: Unfortunately for mine I have to put a request 😕
8/4/23, 03:30 - +91 99960 60246: With all required docs
8/4/23, 03:30 - +91 99960 60246: So that's why I was asking
8/4/23, 03:33 - Soumya RIT: Do I need to submit a sealed transcript envelope even tho I’ve already sent them an official online transcripts directly from my old university?
8/4/23, 03:33 - +91 99960 60246: Not required but carry them for backup
8/4/23, 03:33 - +91 99164 14931: If you've already sent, you won't have to do it again
8/4/23, 03:36 - Soumya RIT: But I’ve sent electronic ones. But official
8/4/23, 03:38 - +91 99164 14931: You can check on your application page if they've marked your transcripts as received
8/4/23, 03:50 - Soumya RIT: Oh okay
8/4/23, 03:50 - +91 90070 10329: Check your application portal, if it has a green tick beside the item you don't need it anymore
8/4/23, 03:51 - Soumya RIT: Okay thanks
8/4/23, 03:56 - +91 83061 85883: Send him the link no

8/4/23, 04:20 - +91 91670 73423: Yesterday I visited Thomas Cook. They were charging me Rs 84.6 / $. I bought few $s from a neighboring exchange at Rs 83.7 / $
8/4/23, 04:22 - +91 91670 73423: I am carrying the niyo global equitas card.
8/4/23, 04:41 - +91 90826 06838: Let's just say i don't want to own any kind of forex card. Am thinking to just carry some cash in dollars(I'll convert it in dollars from india). And I plan to open a savings account as soon as I touch Rochester. Will that be fine or is It necessary to have a forex card?
8/4/23, 04:42 - +91 80079 17207: Was thinking about the same thing
8/4/23, 04:58 - +91 97697 85096: Thank you
8/4/23, 05:03 - +91 90016 67285: Take a credit card, because you will need it to book an uber
8/4/23, 05:03 - +91 90016 67285: From the airport
8/4/23, 05:03 - +91 90016 67285: They dont accept cash
8/4/23, 05:03 - +91 90016 67285: In these situations forex card is handy

8/4/23, 05:17 - +91 91670 73423: You need some money just for initial weeks. Opening an account takes time. You need to take an appointment first and then after 2-3 days you can open it. Cash or forex card anyone will do, whatever you're comfortable carrying. Forex card will allow you to have a flexible balance and some theft security.

8/4/23, 07:00 - +91 96192 64870: Anyone has taken loan from icici bank
8/4/23, 07:00 - +91 96192 64870: ?
8/4/23, 07:01 - +91 88063 09008: Yes
8/4/23, 07:03 - +91 80079 17207: Yes
8/4/23, 09:05 - +91 90826 06838: Guys how do you know that you have paid the fees? Do you get any receipt? Or the semester summary ka balance is zero
8/4/23, 09:06 - +91 91670 73423: If your paying through flywire, you will get a flywire receipt
8/4/23, 09:07 - Dhairya Dutt RIT ParkPoint: Yes and it take around 2 days to process
8/4/23, 09:08 - +91 91670 73423: Yeah, and more for RIT to update
8/4/23, 09:15 - +91 90826 06838: My loan provider automatically paid the fees by connecting to the college now if I go to payment plans its saying there is no due.
8/4/23, 09:17 - +91 90826 06838: Also, in the student account tab the balance is mentioned as 

Balance: $ xxx Credit. 

Meaning that I have paid the fees and I have a surplus amount of xxx dollars, right?
8/4/23, 09:18 - +91 90826 06838: Also, does RIT provide any fee recipt?
8/4/23, 09:19 - +1 (213) 331-8875: You will need a card as you can't book a cab without a card and manymore.…
8/4/23, 09:19 - +91 90826 06838: Not even a yellow taxi?
8/4/23, 09:23 - +91 96732 00508: Yes, whatever email id u mentioned while paying the fees will recieve receipt
8/4/23, 09:24 - +91 90826 06838: How many days does it take?
8/4/23, 09:24 - +91 96732 00508: This message was deleted
8/4/23, 09:24 - +91 90826 06838: I guess the fess got paid 14hours ago by the loan provider.
8/4/23, 09:24 - +91 96732 00508: Immediately we receive it
8/4/23, 09:27 - +91 73870 43914: People keep asking this question repeatedly, so here I go:

1. Open your eservices page (eservices.rit.edu).
2. Navigate to the "amount due" section.
3. Click on the button that says "make payment". This will take you to the flywire page.
4. Click on International Payment.
5. Select "Pay in USD" (or "Pay in INR", consult with your bank for this).
6. Enter the amount mentioned on your eservices page and click on the button that says "pay".
7. Follow the instructions written regarding the form and payment.
8. Flywire will then generate a receipt.
9. From here on ask your bank because for some banks, the process is bank -> your account -> RIT, while for others (primarily HDFC), its bank -> RIT.

8/5/23, 00:51 - Hetav Patel, RIT: Contact your advisor...I submitted my provisional and it's showing ticked out
8/5/23, 00:51 - +91 90070 10329: When did you submit them? Sometimes it takes some time to reflect on the portal
8/5/23, 00:52 - +91 99960 60246: Yesterday I submitted my remaining transcripts and provisional certificate. The transcripts are ticket out but not the degree certificate
8/5/23, 00:53 - +91 83061 85883: Give them at least some time. It's weekend
8/5/23, 00:54 - +91 90070 10329: It's 1am there and will soon be Saturday so wait till monday evening to email them.
8/5/23, 00:56 - +91 99960 60246: Sure 
Have you guys also given your migration certificate and character certificate as part of the transcripts?
8/5/23, 01:28 - +91 90070 10329: If it's not mentioned in your portal then it's not needed
8/5/23, 01:29 - +91 88501 19519: Transcipts can be submitted in person right
8/5/23, 01:31 - +91 75501 19042: 🥲
8/5/23, 01:37 - +91 96680 07457: Yeah
8/5/23, 02:08 - +91 96031 78706: Hello Guys, We are three friends, in need of short-duration accommodation near RIT or Clayton from 24th August,23  to 15th September, 23, does anyone has any availability? <This message was edited>
8/5/23, 03:48 - +91 99960 60246: Also guys incase you're getting the sealed transcripts with you to submit, does the university requires the photocopied ones or the original certificates in the sealed envelope?
8/5/23, 03:51 - +91 90070 10329: it'll be sealed by your school, that is all rit requires
8/5/23, 03:52 - +91 90070 10329: and schools know what other schools want so you don't have to worry about the sealed envelope
8/5/23, 03:57 - +91 90826 06838: You guys can directly mail(I did it via DHL for 2.2k something)  the sealed transcripts and degree certificates to college just put the UID and your full name on the envelope. And send a mail to college saying you have mailed the transcripts and they will approve it within 24hrs after receiving the documents.
8/5/23, 06:58 - +91 99960 60246: I've got my documents sent through email since that was an option
8/5/23, 06:58 - +91 99960 60246: But my university actually gives us an option of sealing the actual or photocopied documents. So they were asking about that.
8/5/23, 06:59 - +91 99960 60246: So incase if anyone is aware please let me know on urgent basis
8/5/23, 07:13 - +91 96680 07457: Guys, when paying through flywire, the "student email address" refers to your rit email address right?
8/5/23, 07:13 - +91 96680 07457: .edu wala?
8/5/23, 07:13 - +91 91670 73423: Yes
8/5/23, 07:13 - +91 96680 07457: Why don't you do that as well then?
8/5/23, 07:13 - +91 96680 07457: Just take them with you in a sealed envelope, why not?
8/5/23, 07:13 - +91 96680 07457: Thanks
8/5/23, 07:21 - +91 91670 73423: Better to seal the original one
8/5/23, 07:37 - +91 99960 60246: I am definitely doing that. Better to stay on the safe side 😀
8/5/23, 07:37 - +91 96680 07457: You're doing more than me. I don't even have them sealed. I asked rit and they said it doesn't really matter
8/5/23, 07:38 - +91 99960 60246: Well if that's one option I'll be relieved. I live in Hyderabad and my college is in Delhi so I have to get everything posted and my flight is next week. Too hectic 😅
8/5/23, 07:39 - +91 76248 08094: What's all this😮
8/5/23, 07:41 - +91 76248 08094: Are you sure? As far as i know, they need physical copies of them
8/5/23, 07:41 - +91 6361 219 269: if you’ve mailed them through your university, that works
8/5/23, 07:42 - +91 6361 219 269: but they would need that through a secured portal i guess
8/5/23, 07:42 - +91 6361 219 269: look into that
8/5/23, 07:42 - +91 76248 08094: Yeah from the university not your own mail
8/5/23, 07:42 - +91 99960 60246: I've got them sent through my registrar's office
8/5/23, 07:42 - +91 76248 08094: Should be fine then
8/5/23, 07:42 - +91 6361 219 269: yeah that should be fine but look into the secured portal or whatever requirements RIT has when you mail your documents
8/5/23, 07:43 - +91 76248 08094: My college is lazy af, i didn't wanna risk it with asking college to do it so I got the sealed envelope
8/5/23, 07:43 - +91 6361 219 269: same😭
8/5/23, 07:43 - +91 76248 08094: 😂
8/5/23, 07:44 - +91 99960 60246: Yes there are 3 options

8/10/23, 00:45 - +91 73870 43914: More importantly, request your doctor to provide an additional prescription of medicines that are available in the US that can be taken if the currently prescribed ones aren't available. Also, I have taken a third prescription for medicines related to stuff like common cold. I requested my doctor to prescribe over-the-counter medicines so that I can take those even if I lose the prescription (which I most certainly will😅).

9/19/23, 23:13 - +1 (585) 303-6051: Is there any verification at the end, basically I’m asking that is it instantaneous or we’ll have to wait for some days after filling out the forms ?
9/19/23, 23:15 - +1 (908) 935-8654: Not aware of that.

Collect your hire form from your Part-time manager, and give it to the ISS office in SAU.
They will mail you your signed I-20 and ask you to collect your signed hire form that you submitted.
You will also get an SSN form that you need to fill.

You will be carrying your signed hire form, signed I-20, and the SSN form with you + some additional docs (ISS office will let you know) with you on Saturday when we go to the SSN office. <This message was edited>
9/19/23, 23:16 - +1 (585) 303-6051: Yeah I’ve submitted it to the ISS, just need to collect it.

9/19/23, 23:17 - +1 (908) 935-8654: Ok, so you should be getting a mail in couple days after submitting the hire form.. they will give you the SSN form then with your signed hire form
